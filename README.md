# Baha-i-Library-API

## API Design
The design documents for the API live in the `api_design` folder.

### Data Structure
The data structure of the API is found in the `data structure.png` image diagram. It sets out all the entities and data types, and associated tables.

## API paths
The api png files provides a map to the API paths.  The `api.php` is a Laravel file listing of all the paths, http methods and expected REST resource.  In combination with the above, they provide all that is needed to arrive at a first iteration of an OpenApi spec.
